  <p class="abt-me-2" >There are so many things about me I would love to share, but I have linited time and brainspace to keep it all. I'm a sixteen (soon to be seventeen) year old currently attending BHSS, and am non-binary identifying using they/them or he/him pronouns. I love so many things about life, mostly my beautiful kitty cat Goose, but I also love my family. </p>
  <button class="nxt-button-2">next</button>
  <p class="abt-me-3">I actually have lots of family involved in the tech industry that I wasn't super aware of until recently. My uncle on my mom's side, my cousin on my mom's side, my great-uncle, just to name a few. even my grandpa dabbled in tech in the 60s and 70sat IU, and remembers using one of IU's first computers to creat a code.</p>
  <button class="nxt-button-3">next</button>
  <p class="abt-me-4">And now, I have begun being involved in the tech industry, along with my twin brother schris, who has gone through these whole five weeks of learnin along with me. Being a twin may be rough at points, but I'm so gratteful for that</p>
  <button class="nxt-button-4">next</button>
  <p class="abt-me-5">But, back to things about me and what I like, I'll share some of my favortie (and least favorite) things in the world, and life. I love the color green, and hate neon colors. I love being outdoors, but hate the heat. I love the rain, but hate coming inside with soggy clothes. I thought I knew what I wanted to do after high school, but after all this, now I am very confused again. </p>
